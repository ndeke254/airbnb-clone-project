# Airbnb Clone

A full-stack web application replicating the core functionality of Airbnb, 
built with a focus on scalable backend architecture, secure API design, 
and modern development practices.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project is designed to:
*   Develop a robust, production-ready booking platform clone

*   Implement secure user authentication and authorization systems

*   Create scalable backend architecture with RESTful/GraphQL APIs

*   Design and optimize database schemas for complex relationships

*   Establish efficient CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

*   Master containerization and deployment best practices using Docker

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend Framework:** Django / Django REST Framework
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **API Layer:** GraphQL (with Graphene)
*   **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
*   **Deployment:** (To be determined - e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean)

üë• Team Roles

Successful backend project development relies on a clear separation of responsibilities. 
Our team structure is designed to leverage individual strengths and 
comprehensive coverage of all critical system components.

Backend Lead / Architect: Owns the overall system design, 
ensures architectural consistency across services, makes high-level technology decisions,
and defines API contracts. This role is responsible for scalability plans and integration strategies.

API Developer: Focuses on building robust, well-documented, and secure RESTful/GraphQL endpoints.
Implements business logic, request validation, authentication, and authorization middleware.

Database Administrator (DBA): Designs, implements, and optimizes the database schema.
Responsible for writing efficient queries, managing migrations,
ensuring data integrity, and planning for backups and replication.

DevOps Engineer: Manages the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions), containerization (Docker),
and deployment processes. Ensures the environment is reproducible, automated, and reliable.
Handles monitoring and scaling infrastructure.

Security Specialist: Implements security best practices across the application,
including input sanitization, authentication (JWT/OAuth), authorization checks,
and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Develops and executes test plans.
Writes automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure code quality 
and prevent regressions. Works closely with developers to identify and fix bugs.
